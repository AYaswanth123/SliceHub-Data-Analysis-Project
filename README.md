Hi, 
Iâ€™m Yaswanth, and this project focuses on data analysis for SliceHub Pizzeria, a restaurant specializing in crafting and serving a variety of pizzas. 
The pizzeria is currently facing challenges in understanding customer preferences, optimizing inventory, and maximizing revenue. These issues are leading to 
potential customer churn due to the unavailability of popular pizza types and sizes, as well as inefficiencies in pricing strategies. Additionally, the company 
struggles with accurately forecasting demand and managing supply chain logistics, which could result in increased operational costs and lost sales opportunities.

To address these challenges, I conducted an in-depth analysis of order patterns, pizza pricing, and revenue distribution. The goal is to provide strategic recommendations 
that will improve business decision-making and enhance customer satisfaction.

The datasets, SQL script, and documentation of the project have been uploaded for review and reference.
